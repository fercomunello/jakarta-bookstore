The Jakarta Bookstore is a **multi-tenancy system for bookstores** where each bookstore has its data isolated from other companies in a security and reliable way.
We want to keep the system architecture very pragmatic but also very optimized, safe and stable for the long term (see the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)) - that's why we choose to adopt the Jakarta EE specification for the back-end/middle-tier layers and plain TypeScript
with Webpack for the front-end side, must watch this nice presentation by Adam Bien: [What happens if you apply the Thin-WAR Java EE ideas to build HTML5 apps?](https://adambien.blog/roller/abien/entry/build_to_last_from_frontend).
